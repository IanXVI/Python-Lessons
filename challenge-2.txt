Well, I am Ian and I am an alcoholic... Just kidding.. This is just a side of me, Sarcastic :) I like writing stories, photography, science and learning new things.
I think I have a fairly decent knowledge at Math, I am taking AP Math right now and I have managed to keep my grades above 90.
I'm taking on programming just to keep options open, to discover new things and find new hobbies. I am also a co-leader of our sustainability club and
I am hoping to use what I learned here to develop something that could benefit our team.
I usually learn things visually so I don't really do well when I read instructions but I can still manage, I ask a lot of questions but I also 
take risks to learn from my mistakes. If I am stuck, I think a call on discord could help me out :) 

That's all

++ I have made an addition to your code. This is very cool! Do one for me.
